## Introduction

Here are some additional tools which have come across my path. Check out my previous post
[Tools for Travel]({% link _posts/2017-03-21-tools-for-travel.md %}), which
covers the basic TSA restrictions along with a bunch of various suggestions for
tools and tool combinations.

## Juice CS3

If you're looking for a more compact one piece tool than the earlier 
[Style PS](http://amzn.to/2n2co3O) suggestion, there is a new tool released by
Leatherman. The Leatherman [Juice CS3](http://amzn.to/2vRgK3B) which combines
bottle opener, scissors, and corkscrew. The bottle opener tools is configured
to also provide leverage when using the corkscrew. It might be the perfect
compact corkscrew tool that's TSA friendly. Most full size corkscrews have
a blade which excludes them from carry-on.

## Conclusion

So, even with the current restrictions, you can travel with a pretty complete set of tools in a compact case.
I didn't touch on flashlights or consumable tools (batteries, duct tape, wire, zip-ties etc.) but I'll reserve those for another post.
I was originally going to have a section on building a check-in tool-set but this post is already super long so I'll wrap it up here.
